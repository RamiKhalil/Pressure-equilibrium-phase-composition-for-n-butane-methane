# Pressure-equilibrium-phase-composition-for-n-butane-methane

To Run the program simply run the file scripttermproject.m and wait from 6 to 13 seconds to display the results

The objective of the project is to write a Matlab program to predict the behavior of a binary methane and n-butane mixture and construct a plot of pressure vs x1 (methane) at a constant temperature of 100 degrees Fahrenheit. The behavior should be predicted by performing flash calculations of thermodynamic equations obtained from the “Equilibrium constants from a modified Redlich- Kwong equation of state” paper with the aid of the use the Wilson equation (Wilson, 1968) to predict an initial guess of the equilibrium constants used in the flash calculations.

The Wilson equation is the following:
ln(𝐾_i) = ln(𝑃_ci/𝑃) + 5.37(1 + 𝑤_i)(1 − 𝑇_ci/𝑇)

Where,
• 𝐾_i is the ideal equilibrium constant of each component
• 𝑃_ci is the critical pressure of each component
• 𝑇_ci is the critical temperature of each component
• T is the temperature under which the experiment is done
• 𝑊_i is the acentric factor of each component


The following criteria was used to obtain the plot for flash calculations (no modifications were used):
• 𝑍_methane=0.001;𝑍_butane=0.9999 to obtain the first chunk of the graph from the left.
• 𝑍_methane= 0.2; 𝑍_butane=0.80; to obtain the next small chunk of the graph.
• 𝑍_methane= 0.4; 𝑍_butane=0.6 to obtain the near end of the graph.
• 𝐹𝑖𝑛𝑎𝑙𝑦, 𝑍_methane=0.75; 𝑍_butane=0.25 to close the last bit of the graph from the top.
